# 🚁 Drone Technology

A comprehensive solution to calculate the **Thrust Coefficient (Ct)** and **Power Coefficient (Cp)** of motor and propeller combinations — essential parameters for evaluating drone propulsion efficiency.

## 📊 What It Does

This tool helps engineers and enthusiasts determine:

- 🔧 **Thrust Coefficient (Ct)** – quantifies how effectively a propeller converts rotational energy into thrust.
- ⚡ **Power Coefficient (Cp)** – indicates how much power is required for a given thrust and rotational speed.

## ✨ Features

- Supports multiple motor-propeller configurations
- Inputs: RPM, voltage, current, thrust (N), air density, propeller diameter & pitch
- Outputs: Ct and Cp values using KNN Algorithm
- Optional data logging and visualization
